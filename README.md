## User Interface - Layout

movies by: most popular, highest rated.

thumbnails.

synopsis.

## Network API Implementation
1. (DONE)In a background thread, app queries the /movie/popular or /movie/top_rated API for the sort criteria specified in the settings menu.
2. App requests for related videos for a selected movie via the /movie/{id}/videos endpoint in a background thread and displays those details when the user selects a movie.
3. App requests for user reviews for a selected movie via the /movie/{id}/reviews endpoint in a background thread and displays those details when the user selects a movie.
## Suggestions to Make Your Project Stand Out!
1. Extend the favorites ContentProvider to store the movie poster, synopsis, user rating, and release date, and display them even when offline.
2. Implement sharing functionality to allow the user to share the first trailerâ€™s YouTube URL from the movie details screen.
